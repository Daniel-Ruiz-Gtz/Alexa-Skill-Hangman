## Introduction üöÄ

This project is developed for the Software Engineering Seminar I class, and it involves creating an Alexa skill. Alexa is the voice-controlled virtual assistant created by Amazon and launched in November 2014 along with its line of smart speakers called Echo. After research and completing some courses, we were able to develop the classic game "Hangman." The game consists of the skill randomly selecting a word from its database, and then you will guess the letters. If you find a correct letter, it will tell you its position, and you repeat this process until you guess the entire word.
